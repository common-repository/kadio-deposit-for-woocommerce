== Description ==

Kadio Digital Factory is the solutions development service of Kadio Consulting. We are committed to develop digital solutions for our customers, as well as internal projects like modules to serve the CMS communities such as WordPress.
For many of our customers projects, we needed to implement deposit payment functionality. The deposit should be based on the total amount of the order. As we could not find an appropriate plugin for that functionality, we therefore decided to develop the Kadio deposit for Woocommerce plugin for a general concept of use.
It has never been so simple, flexible and complete to use deposit payment functionalities on Woocommerce as with Kadio deposit for Woocommerce.
Kadio deposit for Woocommerce allows to setup the deposit payment functionality with advanced settings.
Itâ€™s up to you to decide

-	At which level the deposit must be applied: Product level, cart total amount level, including shipping fees or not ?
-	Where to display useful and custom information? On checkout page, thank you page, user account, emails, order detail in back office. You have the appropriate settings in your hands.
-	How deposit and coupon work together? One click to activate the appropriate option and itâ€™s done

Since release 2.0.0, the module is fully tested as compatible with Stripe, Paypal and Payplug for the online payment Gateway you may like to use.

This module is very simple to setup and offers a high opportunity to increase customer conversion for your ecommerce platform.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's special about the Kadio deposit for Woocommerce plugin? =

Kadio deposit for Woocommerce is the first Woocommerce plugin that allows you to offer customers of your e-commerce store, the payment of a deposit on the total amount of the cart. Other deposit management plugins offer a deposit per product. This certainly has advantages in some contexts but for example, if you are a hotelier, a restaurant owner, a tourism professional, these solutions of deposit by product will not be adapted to your need.
